Partial demo

## Features
- The main screen provides a scrollable list of courses, as well as filtering and sorting functions.
- The user can add, edit, and remove course information. Input validation is applied on the add and edit screens.
- The course background colour changes based on the grade.
- Toggling the WD switch will store/restore the last inputted numerical grade.
- The app responds to device orientation changes.

This page is in progress and the current demo is incomplete.
